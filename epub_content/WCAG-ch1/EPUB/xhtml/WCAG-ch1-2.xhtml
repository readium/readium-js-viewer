                    <p><em>Movement</em> • People settle where they can most easily and comfortably meet their
                        needs for clean water, food, work, communication, trade, and transportation. Before
                        there were good roads, boats were the easiest way to travel or send and receive goods.
                        As a result, people often settled near rivers, lakes, and oceans. They also often
                        settled where the land was suitable for cultivation, and the climate was comfortable.
                        You will not find many cities in the frozen wastelands of Siberia.</p>

                            understanding of other peoples ways of life. Advances in communication and
                            transportation, such as the Internet and high-speed planes, have brought people
                            closer together. So have increased international trade and immigration. Knowledge
                            of other societies is the key to understanding them.</p>

                        <p>Social studies is a way to learn about the world. It draws on information from five
                            fields of learning, geography, history, economics, government, and culture. Each
                            field looks at the world from a different angle. Consider the approaches you might
                            use if you were starting at a new school. Figuring out how to get around would be
                            learning your school's geography. Asking other students where they come from is
                            learning their history. Making choices about which school supplies you can afford
                            to buy is economics. Learning the school rules is learning about its government.
                            Clubs, teams, styles of clothing, holidays, and even ways of saying things are
                            part of the school's culture.</p>

                                <p>Amartya Sen (ah MART yah sen) was born in India. As a professor at Trinity
                                    College in Cambridge, England, he taught and studied economics. An
                                    important part of his research was to look at catastrophes, such as
                                    famine, that happen to the world's poorest people. By showing governments
                                    that food shortages are often caused by social and economic conditions, he
                                    hoped to prevent famines in the future. In 1998, Sen won the Nobel Prize
                                    in Economic Sciences for his research in welfare economics.</p>

                        <p>Indian troops serving in the army of the British East India Company rebelled today.
                            Reasons given for the revolt include anger at the way the company has been taking
                            over Indian lands and a lack of respect for Indian customs. The immediate cause
                            was the new Enfield rifles issued to the troops. To load them, soldiers have to
                            bite off the ends of the cartridges. Word quickly spread that the cartridges were
                            greased with cow and pig fat. This was an insult to both Hindu and Muslim
                            soldiers. Hindus hold cows sacred and never kill them. Muslims believe the meat of
                            pigs is unclean.</p>

                            <p>The map above shows the major culture regions of the world. Latin America is
                                one culture region. The Spanish and Portuguese languages help to tie its
                                people together. So does its common history. Southwest Asia and North Africa
                                is another culture region. Most countries in this region share a common desert
                                climate and landscape. People have adapted to the desert in similar ways, thus
                                creating a common culture. Islam, which is the major religion in this region,
                                also helps shape a common culture.</p>
                            <p>Usually, not every person in a region belongs to the dominant, or mainstream,
                                culture. Some regions are multicultural. For example, the United States and
                                Canada contain other cultures besides the dominant one. Although most people
                                in this region speak English, many people in eastern Canada speak French. Many
                                people in the United States speak Spanish, especially in the Southwest. In
                                both countries, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and members
                                of other religions all flourish.</p>

                                <p><em>Children Invent Language</em> - In the late 1800s, most people in
                                    Hawaii spoke English or native Hawaiian. In 1880, people began arriving
                                    from other countries to work in the sugar cane fields, and they spoke
                                    Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>
                                <p>At school, the children of these immigrants began speaking a form of
                                    English that was a blend of native Hawaiian, Pidgin English, Pidgin
                                    Hawaiian, and their native languages, especially Portuguese. Eventually,
                                    children began to learn this form of English as their native langauge.
                                    This was the beginning of Hawaii Creole English, and it soon became the
                                    language of the majority of Hawaiians.</p>

                            <p>For thousands of years, culture regions have changed and evolved as they have
                                borrowed culture traits from one another. They have also come to depend upon
                                each other economically. Decisions and events in one part of the world affect
                                other parts. Advances in transportation and communication have increased this
                                    <span epub:type="keyword" id="gt_10">interdependence</span>. When
                                oil-producing nations in the Middle East raise the price of oil, for example,
                                the price of gasoline at the neighborhood gas station is likely to rise. If
                                there is an especially abundant banana crop in parts of Latin America, the
                                price of bananas may drop at the local grocery store. More and more, people of
                                different countries are becoming part of one world.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p><span class="uc">From the earliest times</span>, people have created myths and
                            legends to explain the natural world. Some stories explain why earthquakes occur
                            or lightning strikes. Others tell how rivers, deserts, canyons, and other
                            landforms came to be. This ancient Chinese myth, dating back at least 2,500 years,
                            comes from the area of northern China where Chinese civilization first began. The
                            myth explains how the province of Shaanxi got its mountains.</p>
                        <p>Shaanxi, also known as Shensi, is in northern China.The southern part of the
                            province contains the high and rugged Qinling Range, also called the Tsinling
                            Mountains, where the average peak is 8,000 feet high and some are over 12,000 feet
                            high.</p>
                        <p>Long ago, soon after time began, giants roamed the flat and fertile Earth. One of
                            the largest, bravest, and fastest of them all was named Kuafu-and his strength
                            knew no bounds. Every day, Kuafu watched the sun rise in the east and set in the
                            west.When night came, he became greatly saddened. He thought, "I do not like the
                            darkness. All life falls into a silent slumber. If I could catch the sun, then I
                            could keep night as bright as day. The plants could grow forever, and it would
                            always be warm. I would never have to sleep again."</p>
                        <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="29" id="p29"></span>
                        <p>The next day, Kuafu stretched his legs and started to race after the sun. He ran
                            like the wind over several thousand miles without rest. Finally, he chased the sun
                            to the Yu Valley where it came to rest every day but Kuafu was thirsty and very,
                            very tired. His thirst grew, and soon it became overwhelming. He had never known a
                            thirst like this, and his body seemed to be drying up like mud bricks in an
                            oven.</p>
                        <p>Kuafu found the nearest stream and drank it dry. It was not enough.With a giant's
                            stride, he quickly reached the mighty Yellow River. He drank it dry, but again, it
                            was not enough. He continued toward the Great Sea-surely it held water enough to
                            quench his thirst.</p>
                        <p>On his journey, he drank dry every well and every stream and every lake he came
                            across. His thirst became overpowering, and Kuafu fell to the ground before he
                            reached the Sea. In a fit of anger, with a branch of a peach tree, he made a final
                            swing at the sun. But before the branch reached the sun, Kuafu died of thirst.</p>
                        <p>The sun set in the Yu Valley, and night came. When the sun rose again, Kuafu's body
                            had been transformed into a mountain range. The peach tree branch extended from
                            his side and formed a peach tree grove.To this day, the peaches in this grove are
                            sweet and moist, always ready to relieve the thirst of those who would choose to
                            chase the sun.</p>
