The result of executing the interpreter\r\n//   is to inject an element, or set of elements, into an EPUB content document (which is just an XHTML document). These element(s) will\r\n//   represent the position or area in the EPUB referenced by a CFI.\r\n// Rationale: The AST is a clean and readable expression of the step-terminus structure of a CFI. Although building an interpreter adds to the\r\n//   CFI infrastructure, it provides a number of benefits. First, it emphasizes a clear separation of concerns between lexing/parsing a\r\n//   CFI, which involves some complexity related to escaped and special characters, and the execution of the underlying set of steps\r\n//   represented by the CFI. Second, it will be easier to extend the interpreter to account for new/altered CFI steps (say for references\r\n//   to vector objects or multiple CFIs) than if lexing, parsing and interpretation were all handled in a single step. Finally, Readium's objective is\r\n//   to demonstrate implementation of the EPUB 3.0 spec. An implementation with a strong separation of concerns that conforms to\r\n//   well-understood patterns for DSL processing should be easier to communicate, analyze and understand.\r\n// REFACTORING CANDIDATE: node type errors shouldn't really be possible if the CFI syntax is correct and the parser is error free.\r\n//   Might want to make the script die in those instances, once the grammar and interpreter are more stable.\r\n// REFACTORING CANDIDATE: The use of the 'nodeType' property is confusing as this is a DOM node property and the two are unrelated.\r\n//   Whoops.

The simplest approach is to use this to\r\n                    store the characters moved when moving both the start and end of the range to the start of the document\r\n                    body and subtracting the start offset from the end offset (the \"move-negative-gazillion\" method).\r\n                    However, this is extremely slow when the document is large and the range is near the end of it. Clearly\r\n                    doing the mirror image (i.e. moving the range boundaries to the end of the document) has the same\r\n                    problem.\r\n                    \r\n                    Another approach that works is to use moveStart() to move the start boundary of the range up to the end\r\n                    boundary one character at a time and incrementing a counter with the value returned by the moveStart()\r\n                    call. However, the check for whether the start boundary has reached the end boundary is expensive, so\r\n                    this method is slow (although unlike \"move-negative-gazillion\" is largely unaffected by the location of\r\n                    the range within the document).\r\n                    \r\n                    The method below is a hybrid of the two methods above. It uses the fact that a string containing the\r\n                    TextRange's 'text' property with each \\r\\n converted to a single \\r character cannot be longer than the\r\n                    text of the TextRange, so the start of the range is moved that length initially and then a character at\r\n                    a time to make up for any trailing line breaks not contained in the 'text' property.

For the following HTML:\r\n *\r\n * 1 <br>2\r\n *\r\n * - IE and WebKit render the space, include it in the selection (i.e. when the content is selected and pasted into a\r\n *   textarea, the space is present) and allow the caret to be placed after it.\r\n * - Firefox does not acknowledge the space in the selection but it is possible to place the caret after it.\r\n * - Opera does not render the space but has two separate caret positions on either side of the space (left and right\r\n *   arrow keys show this) and includes the space in the selection.\r\n *\r\n * The other case is the line break or breaks implied by block elements. For the following HTML:\r\n *\r\n * <p>1 </p><p>2<p>\r\n *\r\n * - WebKit does not acknowledge the space in any way\r\n * - Firefox, IE and Opera as per <br>\r\n *\r\n * One more case is trailing spaces before line breaks in elements with white-space: pre-line.

We use so called \"partial CFI\"s, a tuple containing idref of the spine item and the CFI definition relative to the root of the spine item.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the API exposed via `ReaderView` exposes 4 functions and 1 even which should be sufficient for a simple highlighting workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n# API\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the examples below, `RReader` is a previously instantiated `ReaderView` instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Is anything selected (getCurrentSelectionCfi())\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the highlighting workflow it is sometimes necessary to determine whether the user has in fact selected anything. This can be accomplished with the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t> RReader.getCurrentSelectionCfi()\r\n\tObject {idref: \"id-id2604743\", cfi: \"/4/2/6,/1:74,/1:129\"}\r\n\r\nThe response contains a partial CFI that is sufficient to create a highlight based on selection. If nothing is selected *undefined* is returned. \r\n\r\nYou can also use partial Cfi with `openSpineItemElementCfi()` to navigate to where this selection is later.\r\n\r\n## Highlighting (addHighlight and addSelectionHighlight)\r\n\r\nOnce we've determined what needs to be highlighted (by generating a partial CFI from a selection, or having an existing partial CFI stored externally) we can add it to the reader by calling `addHighlight()`:\r\n\r\n\t> RReader.addHighlight('id-id2604743', \"/4/2/6,/1:74,/1:129\", 123, \"highlight\")\r\n\tObject {CFI: \"/4/2/6,/1:74,/1:129\", selectedElements: Array[1], idref: \"id-id2604743\"}\r\n\r\n*addHighligh*t takes the following parameters:\r\n\r\n- *id-id2604743* - `idref` is the idref value from `getCurrentSelectionCfi()\r\n- * /4/2/6,/1:74,/1:129* - `cfi` is the cfi value from `getCurrentSelectionCfi()\r\n- *123* - `id` is the unique id that defines this annotation\r\n- *highlight* - 'type' of annotation. only 'highlight' is currently supported.\r\n\r\n### addSelectioHighlight\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can call addSelectionHighlight(). It combines both getCurrentSelectionCfi() and addHighlight into one call:\r\n\r\n\t> RReader.addSelectionHighlight(124, \"highlight\")\r\n\tObject {CFI: \"/4/2/4,/1:437,/1:503\", selectedElements: Array[1], idref: \"id-id2604743\"}\r\n\r\nNote that it provides no validation. If nothing is selected, `undefined` is returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Removing highlights \r\n\r\nTo remove the highlight, call `removeHighlight`:\r\n\r\n\t> RReader.removeHighlight(123)\r\n\tundefined\r\n\r\n\r\n# Handling annotation click events\r\n\r\nWhen a user clicks on a highlight `annotationClicked` event is dispatched with the following arguments:\r\n\r\n- type of annotation\r\n- idref of the spine item\r\n- partial Cfi of the annotation\r\n- annotationdId\r\n\r\n\r\n\t> RReader.on('annotationClicked', function(type, idref, cfi, annotationId) { console.log (type, idref, cfi, annotationId)});\r\n\tViews.ReaderView {on: function, once: function, off: function, trigger: function, listenTo: function???}\r\n\t\r\nThen when the user clicks on the highlight the following will show up in the console:\r\n\r\n\thighlight id-id2604743 /4/2/6,/1:74,/1:129 123 \r\n\t\r\n\r\n*/\r\ndefine('readium_plugin_annotations/annotations_manager',['jquery', 'underscore', 'eventEmitter', './annotations_module'], function($, _, EventEmitter, EpubAnnotationsModule) {\r\n/**\r\n *\r\n * @param proxyObj\r\n * @param options\r\n * @constructor\r\n */\r\nvar AnnotationsManager = function (proxyObj, options) {\r\n\r\n    var self = this;\r\n    var liveAnnotations = {};\r\n    var spines = {};\r\n    var proxy = proxyObj; \r\n    var annotationCSSUrl = options.annotationCSSUrl;\r\n\r\n    if (!annotationCSSUrl) {\r\n        console.warn(\"WARNING!
